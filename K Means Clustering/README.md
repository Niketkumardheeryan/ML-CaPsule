# KMeans Clustering Project

## Problem Statement

As a business owner of a supermarket mall, understanding customer behavior is crucial for effective marketing strategies. However, with a large customer base, it can be challenging to manually analyze and categorize customers. Therefore, the goal is to use machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, to segment customers based on their attributes such as age, annual income, and spending score.

## Importance of Clustering for Marketing

Customer segmentation is essential for targeted marketing strategies. By identifying distinct groups of customers, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to better meet the needs and preferences of each segment. This can lead to improved customer satisfaction, increased sales, and higher retention rates. Clustering also helps in identifying potential high-value customers and understanding their behaviors and preferences.

## Project Description

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. It aims to identify distinct groups of customers based on their features such as age, annual income, and spending score. The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset and preprocessing it by converting categorical variables to numerical ones and standardizing the features.

2. **Elbow Method**: Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.

3. **KMeans Clustering**: Applying the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment the customers into distinct clusters based on their features.

4. **Visualizing the Clusters**: Visualizing the clusters using scatter plots to understand the characteristics of each cluster.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `KMeans_Clustering.ipynb` to execute the project.

## Results

The main output of the project is the visualization of the clusters obtained from the KMeans clustering algorithm. A scatter plot is used to visualize the clusters based on the scaled annual income and spending score.
