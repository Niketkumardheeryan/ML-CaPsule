# Dog Breed Classification

This project implements an end-to-end dog breed classification model using deep learning. The model identifies different dog breeds from images, leveraging transfer learning for high accuracy on a complex, multi-class dataset. This can be useful in applications for animal shelters, veterinary clinics, and pet adoption websites where breed identification can be automated.

## Overview

The notebook provides a step-by-step approach for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify various dog breeds from images. The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model through transfer learning, allowing us to leverage previously learned features to achieve high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of thousands of labeled dog breed images across multiple categories. Each image is associated with a label that represents a specific breed. This diverse dataset enables the model to generalize well across different types of dog breeds.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial loading and visualization of images to understand dataset distribution.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model robustness.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Utilizes transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
  - Custom fully connected layers are added for classification across dog breeds.
- **Training and Evaluation**:
  - Tracks training and validation metrics to monitor model performance.
  - Early stopping and dropout techniques are applied to prevent overfitting.
- **Performance Metrics**: Final model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
