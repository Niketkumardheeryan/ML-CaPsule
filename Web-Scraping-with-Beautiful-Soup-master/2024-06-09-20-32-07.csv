"This was for my brother.He doesn’t buy things for himself much so I took over and bought for him and very glad I did.1- The T-shirts looks exactly like what is shown in the image on the amazon website. No color difference, no cheap writing nothing sort of that.2- Quality of the product it pretty cool too. Doesn’t itch, doesn’t crumple when worn multiple times, smooth feel.3- Looks stylish and sophisticated, doesn’t look cheap. Price wise also it’s pretty impressive as compare to the quality.",Reviewed in India on 3 April 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Not worth its price at all. Usually I do not write many reviews ....good ...very good or bad.However, this is a stuff with very poor quality standard ... does not qualify to be in AMAZON basket. 2nd wash and gone.Can the seller or Amazon guide me on THE WAY FORWARD?",Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars

Product quality is as per given specification. Only one thing is not good that is in some of t-shirts logo is in plastic kind of print so don't wash it along with other clothes and not wash is hardly.,Reviewed in India on 7 December 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Although this is a pair of three and ideally must be of equal size, one of the t-shirt was of a smaller size but labeled as 'L'. Reducing the star rating for the same reason. As for the comfort, it is very comfortable and looks like a pretty above average product. Some might even call it premium looking, but that would solely depend upon an individual.",Reviewed in India on 22 October 2020,3.0 out of 5 stars
