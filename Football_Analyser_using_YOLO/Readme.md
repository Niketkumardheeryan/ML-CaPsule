# Football Player Detection and Monitoring System Using YOLO.

Welcome to the Football Player Detection and Monitoring System! This project is an industry-level endeavor aimed at providing precise detection and monitoring capabilities for football players, referees, and the ball using state-of-the-art YOLO models and various utility libraries.

## Features

- **Player Tracking**: Track individual players with high precision.
- **Team Separation**: Distinguish between players from different teams.
- **Camera Movement Tracking**: Monitor camera movements for enhanced analysis.
- **Distance and Speed Monitoring**: Calculate distance covered by players and their speed during movement.
- **Ball Tracking**: Accurately trace the movement of the ball.
- **Team Possession Analysis**: Analyze team possession based on player movements.
  
## Libraries Used

<b>You can either install all these libraries one by one by doing : python -m pip install <library_name> or include all these libraries in a requirements.txt folder in same directory as of project and run the following command in a new cmd : "pip install -r requirements.txt" , whatever suits you. </b> 

- Python
- OpenCV
- Supervision
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- YOLO
  

## Folder Structure

- **models**: Contains YOLO model weights.
- **scripts**: Houses all the Python scripts.
- **output**: Stores the output generated by the system.

## Usage

1. Configure the system by modifying parameters in the scripts if needed.
2. Run the main script to start the detection and monitoring process.
3. View the output generated in the `output` folder.
