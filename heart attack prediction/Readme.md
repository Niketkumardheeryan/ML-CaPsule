Heart Attack Risk Prediction

This project is a heart attack risk prediction application built using Python and PyQt5. It uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset to predict the risk of a heart attack based on various input parameters.

Usage

Enter the required parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, etc. into the input fields.
Click the "Predict" button to get the prediction result and risk message.
The application will display a pie chart showing the risk levels (low risk vs. high risk) based on the prediction.
