# PROJECT TITLE

FIFA 19 Dataset Analysis

## GOAL

**Aim -** Analyze different aspects of the dataset and provide the pattern of the dataset from the visualization.

## DATASET

## DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem where we analyze the FiFA 19 Data and predict the value. We use Linear Regression, Decision Tree  and Random Forest Regressor.

## WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. It starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
3. We calculate statistical data in the dataset
4. Then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
5. Data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
6. Finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
7. Also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms

## MODELS USED

1. Linear Regression= simplest and most common algorithm used for classification problems
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Random Forest Regressor


## LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-Learn

## ACCURACIES

1. Linear Regression Score = 64.99%
2. Random Forest Regressor = 99.04%
3. Decision Tree  = 99.86%

## CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Decision Tree gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
