# PROJECT TITLE

CS:GO Round Winner Classification

## GOAL

**Aim** - Predict who wins individual snapshots of rounds

## DATASET

## DESCRIPTION

This is a classification problem where we we predict who wins individual snapshots of rounds. We use Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier

## WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. It starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
3. We calculate statistical data in the dataset
4. Then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
5. Data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
6. Finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
7. Also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms

## MODELS USED

1. Logistic Regression= simplest and most common algorithm used for classification problems
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest Classifier


## LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-Learn

## ACCURACIES

1. Logistic Regression Score = 73.76%
2. Random Forest Classifier = 88%
3. Decision Tree- 81.96%

## CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Random Forest Classifier gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
