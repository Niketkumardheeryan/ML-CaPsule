### Ultimate House Price Prediction üè†üí∞

Welcome to the Ultimate House Price Prediction project! Here, we've meticulously curated a predictive model for housing prices, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Dive into the details of data cleaning, visualization, encoding, model training, and evaluation in the MAIN HOUSING Jupyter notebook (`MAIN_HOUSING.ipynb`). The housing dataset is available in `housing.csv`.

#### Project Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices with utmost precision. We've meticulously curated, cleaned, filtered, scaled, and fine-tuned the dataset to ensure robust model performance.

#### Dataset
- **Source**: California Housing Data
- **Training Examples**: ~16,000
- **Test Examples**: ~4,000

#### Libraries and Dependencies
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

#### Encoding
We employed one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables effectively.

#### Models Trained
- Linear Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

#### Final Model Selection
After rigorous evaluation, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the top performer.

#### Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model's accuracy using cross-validation:
- **RMSE Score**: 48,100.39
- **R Squared Score**: 82.25%

#### Fine-Tuning
Hyperparameter fine-tuning was conducted using Grid Search CV.

### Performance
The overall performance of the model is commendable, exhibiting minimal over/underfitting issues.
