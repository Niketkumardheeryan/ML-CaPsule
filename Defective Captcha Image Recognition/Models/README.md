## üßæ Description

This project involves the comparative analysis of **Five** Keras image detection models, namely **EfficientNetB1** , **ResNet50V2** , **InceptionV3** , **DenseNet121** and **Xception**  applied to a specific dataset. The dataset consists of annotated images related to a particular domain, and the objectives include training and evaluating these models to compare their accuracy scores and performance metrics. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to understand the dataset's characteristics, explore class distributions, detect imbalances, and identify areas for potential improvement. The methodology encompasses data preparation, model training, evaluation, comparative analysis of accuracy and performance metrics, and visualization of EDA insights. 

## üßÆ What I had done!

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation:
    Loaded the dataset containing image paths and corresponding labels into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Bar Chart for Label Distribution: Created a bar chart to visualize the frequency distribution of different labels in the dataset.

    Pie Chart for Label Distribution: Generated a pie chart to represent the proportion of each label in the dataset.

### 3. Data Analysis:
    Counted the number of unique image paths to ensure data uniqueness and quality.
        Analyzed the distribution of image paths by label for the top 20 most frequent paths.
        Displayed the number of unique values for each categorical column to understand data variety.
        Visualized missing values in the dataset using a heatmap to identify and address potential data quality issues.
        Summarized and printed the counts of each label.

### 4. Image Preprocessing and Model Training:
    Loaded and preprocessed the test images, ensuring normalization of pixel values for consistency.
        Iterated through multiple models (VGG16, ResNet50 , Xception) saved in a directory and made predictions on the test dataset.
        Saved the predictions to CSV files for further analysis and comparison.

### 5. Model Prediction Visualization:
    Loaded models and visualized their predictions on a sample set of test images to qualitatively assess model performance.
        Adjusted image preprocessing for models requiring specific input sizes (e.g., 299x299 for Xception).
