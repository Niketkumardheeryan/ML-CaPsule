Questions,Answers
What is global warming?,Global warming is a long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human-made emissions of greenhouse gases.
What causes climate change?,"Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming."
How can we mitigate climate change?,"Climate change can be mitigated through a variety of means such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting the use of renewable energy sources, improving insulation in buildings, and adopting sustainable farming practices."
What is the effect of climate change on biodiversity?,"Climate change affects biodiversity by altering the timing of natural events, shifting habitats, and increasing the rate of disease. In some cases, species may not be able to adapt to these changes quickly enough, which can result in reduced populations and even extinction."
What are greenhouse gases?,"Greenhouse gases are gases in Earth's atmosphere that trap heat. They let sunlight pass through the atmosphere, but they prevent the heat that the sunlight brings from leaving the atmosphere. The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases."
What is carbon footprint?,"A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent."
What is climate change adaptation?,"Climate change adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected climate change and its effects. It is one of the ways to respond to climate change, along with climate change mitigation."
What is the Paris Agreement?,"The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels."
What is the impact of deforestation on climate change?,"Deforestation affects climate change on a large scale, as trees absorb CO2 when they grow. When they are cut down and burned or allowed to rot, their stored carbon is released back into the air."
Can renewable energy sources help combat climate change?,"Yes, shifting to renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydro can significantly help in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and thus combat climate change."
What is the role of individuals in combating climate change?,"Individuals can play a significant role in combating climate change. This can be done by reducing personal carbon footprints, through measures like using energy efficiently, reducing waste, choosing sustainable products, using public transportation, and advocating for policies that support renewable energy and other sustainable practices."
How does climate change affect human health?,"Climate change affects human health in several ways. It can increase heat-related illnesses, exacerbate respiratory disorders due to poor air quality, alter the spread of vector-borne diseases, and increase the risk of illnesses caused by unsafe or insufficient water or lack of food."
What is GR491?,"GR491 is a Handbook of Sustainable Design of Digital Services, created by Institutes for Sustainable IT, learn more at https://gr491.isit-europe.org/en/#main-container"
What is a Carbon footprint?,"The Carbon footprint is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities of a particular individual, organization, or community."
Why is important to measure the Digital Services' carbon footprint?,"Calculating your Digital Solution’s carbon footprint is a necessary step to understanding your company’s contribution to global warming so you can identify ways to reduce it. Plus, consumers are increasingly interested in transparency around the environmental impacts of the products they use"
How to assess the carbon footprint of my digital solution?,"Identify the Digital Solutions that are your sources of carbon dioxide emissions
Collect data and quantify the amount of energy that is used
Look for potential reduction opportunities
Go to Carbon assessment to start your journey"
What can I do to reduce my digital solution carbon footprint?,"Once you have the results of the Carbon assessment, deepen into the results to identify disproportionate emissions sources and think about where there might be opportunities to reduce your footprint, if your main source of emissions is a website that lots of people visit, some small tweaks to the site design can increase its energy efficiency and reduce its carbon footprint."
What is SDG?,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity."
