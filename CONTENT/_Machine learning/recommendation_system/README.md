A content-based recommendation system uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback.<br/>
Step 1: Import and visualize the dataset and select the features to filter recommended items.<br/>
Step 2: Combine all the selected features in a single column.<br/>
Step 3: Tokenize the combined column using a count vectorizer and convert the count matrix into a cosine matrix.<br/>
Step 4: Recommend items based on cosine similarity.<br/>
Step 5: Change the selected features to get varying results.<br/>
