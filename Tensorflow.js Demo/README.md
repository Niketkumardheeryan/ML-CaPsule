## PROJECT TITLE : TENSORFLOW.js DEMO USING IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

#### AIM

To classify the different images uploaded by user using the Tensorflow.js library

#### DESCRIPTION

This is a classification problem where we need to classify various images. We use Tensorflow.js Mobilenet Model.


#### GLANCE AT THE APPLICATION

#### MODELS USED

Tensorflow.js MobileNet Model

This TensorFlow.js model does not require you to know about machine learning. It can take as input any browser-based image elements (<img>, <video>, <canvas> elements, for example) and returns an array of most likely predictions and their confidences.

#### DEPLOYMENT

Tested on local browser, this demo can be deployed to the web like any other html applications using various deployment methods like github.io or Heroku.

This is an output as fetched on the console.

#### LIBRARIES NEEDED

Tensorflow.js library can be installed via the script tag or by using npm.

#### CONCLUSION

We can conclude that our Demo App classifies images with the help of Mobilenet model from the Tensorflow.js library.
