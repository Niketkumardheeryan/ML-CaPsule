# Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project, specifically tailored for the Girl Script Summer of Code in 2024 (GSSoC'24), aims to implement image classification using deep learning techniques. This project aims to implement image classification using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories or classes.

## Overview

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to assign a label or category to an input image based on its content. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has shown remarkable success in image classification tasks due to its ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw pixel data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Keras (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- etc.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images. It's crucial to have a diverse and representative dataset for effective model training. Common datasets for image classification include CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, etc. Ensure that your dataset is properly preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Architecture

The project utilizes a deep neural network architecture for image classification. A typical CNN architecture consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The specific architecture may vary depending on the problem domain and dataset characteristics. The model is trained using the training data and validated using the validation data to ensure optimal performance and prevent overfitting.

## Training

Training the model involves feeding the training data through the network, computing the loss, and updating the model parameters using optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc. The training process continues for multiple epochs until the model converges or until a stopping criterion is met. It's essential to monitor the training process using metrics such as accuracy, loss, etc., and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using the test dataset to assess its performance on unseen data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., are used to measure the model's performance. Additionally, visualizing the model predictions and analyzing misclassified images can provide insights into areas for improvement.

## Usage

To use the trained model for image classification:

1. Load the pre-trained model weights.
2. Preprocess the input image (resize, normalize, etc.).
3. Feed the preprocessed image through the model.
4. Get the predicted class probabilities or labels.
5. Interpret the results and take appropriate actions.

## Future Work

There are several avenues for future work and improvement, including:

- Experimenting with different model architectures.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
- Data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.
- Transfer learning from pre-trained models to leverage knowledge learned on similar tasks or datasets.
