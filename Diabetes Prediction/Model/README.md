PROJECT TITLE : Diabetes Prediction

GOAL : To predict whether the person have diabetes or not.

DATASET : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Diabetes dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used total 10 machine learning algos . In each algo I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , I got the highest accuracy of about 82.47 % using the Logistic Regression which is quite well for the given diabetes dataset . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot ,Regplot etc.


MODELS USED : I used total 10 machine leaning algos in the dataset


Logistic Regression= 82.46 %

KNeighbors Classifier= 75.97 %

SVC= 79.22 %

Naiye Bayes= 75.73 %

Decision Tree Classifier= 73.37%

Random Forest Classifier= 81.57%

Ada Boost Classifier= 77.92%

Gradient Boosting Classifier= 81.81%

XGB Classifier= 78.57%

Extra Trees Classifier= 80.51%


LIBRARIES:

PANDAS

NUMPY

MATPLOTLIB

CONCLUSION :

So we get a good accuracy score of 82.47 % using the Logistic Regression.
The accuracies of other models can be increased using HyperTuning.
