# Personality Prediction System Using Machine Learning

This project implements a personality prediction system using various machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes textual data to predict personality types based on the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) classification.


## Introduction

The Personality Prediction System uses text data to predict the MBTI personality type of an individual. The system leverages multiple machine learning algorithms to perform classification tasks and evaluates their performance.

## Data Analysis

Data analysis involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, performing text processing, and visualizing the results. The system includes the following steps:
- Loading the dataset
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Model Training and Evaluation

The following machine learning algorithms are used for training and evaluation:
- Logistic Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

Performance metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Visualization
The system provides visualizations for data distribution, model performance, and word clouds for the most common words.
