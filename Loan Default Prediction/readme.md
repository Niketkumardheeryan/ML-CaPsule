# Loan Default Prediction with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict loan defaults using deep learning techniques. The system utilizes Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze historical loan data and predict the likelihood of default.

## Objectives

- **Data Processing**: Prepare and preprocess loan data for training.
- **Model Development**: Build and train deep learning models (MLP, CNN, RNN) for predicting loan defaults.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Provide predictions on loan defaults based on the trained models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Additional machine learning tools.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.

# Models
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Purpose: Predict the probability of loan default based on various features.
Architecture: A fully connected neural network with several hidden layers.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Purpose: Extract and learn features from structured loan data to improve prediction accuracy.
Architecture: CNN layers for feature extraction followed by dense layers for classification.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Purpose: Analyze sequential patterns in loan data, such as payment history or borrower behavior over time.
Architecture: LSTM or GRU layers to capture temporal dependencies.
