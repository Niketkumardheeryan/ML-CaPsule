# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-ML

## Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes and patient data.

## Features
- Preprocessing of medical data
- Multiple machine learning models for classification
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Visualization of results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
- Data manipulation: pandas, numpy
- Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart-Disease-detection-using-ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Heart-Disease-detection-using-ML
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available heart disease dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the `data` folder.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and normalize the dataset.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the provided script.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the test set.
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the results and performance metrics.
   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py
   ```
