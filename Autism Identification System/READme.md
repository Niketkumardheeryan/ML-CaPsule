# Autism Identification System

## Overview

Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. However, the current wait times for ASD diagnosis are prolonged, and existing procedures lack cost-effectiveness.

This project aims to address the need for a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening tool using machine learning techniques. By leveraging algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier, this tool aims to streamline the screening process, aiding healthcare professionals and guiding individuals towards pursuing formal clinical diagnosis.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant datasets containing features related to ASD.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for training machine learning models.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features from the data and prepare them for model training.

4. **Model Training**: Utilize Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier algorithms to train predictive models on the preprocessed data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model as a screening tool accessible to healthcare professionals and individuals.

## Tools Used

- Python: The primary programming language for implementing the machine learning models and data preprocessing tasks.
  
- Libraries:
  - scikit-learn: Utilized for implementing the machine learning algorithms and evaluating model performance.
  - pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
  - numpy: Essential for numerical computations and array manipulation.
  - matplotlib and seaborn: Employed for data visualization and result interpretation.
  
- Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Random Forest Classifier
