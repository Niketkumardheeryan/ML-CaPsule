**Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction**

This work aims to accurately predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using a robust Artificial Neural Network model and compares its performance to various machine learning algorithms, ultimately achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%, making it a promising tool for CKD diagnosis.

**Motivation**

Advancing the accuracy of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction is crucial due to its widespread impact and severe consequences. Globally, CKD affects approximately 10% of the population, yet a staggering 90% of cases remain undiagnosed until reaching advanced stages. By improving predictive models, we can detect CKD earlier, potentially reducing complications and improving patient outcomes.

Economically, CKD management consumes 2% to 3% of global healthcare expenditures. Enhanced prediction accuracy can optimize resource allocation, leading to significant cost savings that can be redirected to other critical healthcare needs.

CKD is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Better predictive models not only benefit individual patients by enabling timely intervention but also support broader public health goals, addressing the rising burden of non-communicable diseases. This pursuit of accuracy is vital for shaping effective healthcare strategies and research, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions affected by CKD.
