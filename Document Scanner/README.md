# Document scanning using OpenCV
Document scanning is a common task in offices and personal use. By automating document scanning with computer vision techniques, we can efficiently digitize documents.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a document scanner that can detect documents in images and extract them for further processing or storage.


## What Have I done
1. Loading and importing all the libraries.
2. Importing the image in the Jupyter Notebook.
3. These are following steps - 
    - Preprocessing
       - Applied Gaussian blur
       - Performed edge detection
       - Perspective transformation

4. Conclusion

## Libraries used
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Conclusion
**With the completion of this project, we have successfully implemented a document scanner using OpenCV. This can be further integrated into various applications for digitizing documents efficiently.**
