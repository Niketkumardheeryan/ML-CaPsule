# LipNet

LipNet is a deep learning model designed to recognize speech from video of lips. It's a groundbreaking project that combines the strengths of deep learning with the precision of lip reading, enabling machines to understand speech without the need for audio input. This project aims to bridge the gap between speech recognition and visual understanding, offering a novel approach to communication between humans and machines.
