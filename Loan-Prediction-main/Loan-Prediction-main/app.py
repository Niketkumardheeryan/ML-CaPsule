#When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. 
#For now, we care about the __name__ variable.
#If we execute our code in the main program, like in our case here, it assigns
# __main__ as the name (__name__). 
#So if we want to run our code right here, we can check if __name__ == __main__
#if so, execute it here. 
#If we import this file (module) to another file then __name__ == app (which is the name of this python file).
