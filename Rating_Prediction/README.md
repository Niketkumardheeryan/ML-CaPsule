# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict movie ratings based on various features such as director, actors, genre, etc. Predicting movie ratings can be valuable for filmmakers, studios, and movie enthusiasts to understand audience preferences and optimize production efforts.

## Dataset
### Description
The dataset used in this project, IMDb Movies India.csv, consists of information about Indian movies extracted from IMDb. It includes features such as movie title, director, actors, genre, release year, ratings, and number of voters.

### Source
The dataset IMDb Movies India.csv was obtained from IMDb or a publicly available dataset repository.

### Data Preprocessing
Before applying machine learning algorithms, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values: Nan Valus was removed by Simple Imputer by replacing it with the most frequent and average column values
- Feature engineering: Feature Extraction and Feature selection was performed on the dataset to remove irrelevant columns
- Encoding categorical variables: OneHotEncoding Technique was used to convert categorical data into a numerical representation
- Feature scaling: Normalization and Standardization was done to enhance accuracy

## Data Visualization
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. The following visualizations were created:
- Histograms: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn Histograph was plotted between Genre and Frequency
- Scatter plots: Between Genre, Voters and Rating etc
- Heatmaps: To gain data insight heat map was used to plot Actor 1, Director and Genre Features

## Application of Machine Learning Algorithms
Various machine learning algorithms were applied to predict movie ratings. The following steps were followed:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Selecting appropriate evaluation metrics
- Trying different algorithms such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Regression
- Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like:
  - Grid Search
  - Random Search

## Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and testing on the holdout set. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared were used to assess model performance.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to predict movie ratings using the IMDb Movies India.csv dataset. Future work may involve incorporating additional features, exploring advanced algorithms, and improving model interpretability.
