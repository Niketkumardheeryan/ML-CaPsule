## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing as it helps businesses understand their customer base and tailor their strategies accordingly. This project uses unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
1. Data Preprocessing:

 to clean and prepare the data.
2. Feature Engineering:

to create features for the clustering algorithms.
3. KMeans Clustering:
to apply KMeans clustering on the dataset.
4. DBSCAN Clustering:

to apply DBSCAN clustering on the dataset.
5. Hierarchical Clustering:

to apply Hierarchical clustering on the dataset.
6. Model Evaluation:

to evaluate the performance of the clustering models.
