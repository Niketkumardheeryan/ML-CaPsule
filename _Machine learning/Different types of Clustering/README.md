**PROJECT TITLE:** 
Different types of Clustering

**DATASET:**  
Iris dataset

**WHAT I HAD DONE:**
I present that issue in two parts one is explaination part and the other is coding part to explain in a better way and i use iris dataset to explain different types of clustering.

**Clustering done:**

- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify Clustering Structure)
- Hierarchical Clustering
- K-means clustering
- PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids)

**LIBRARIES NEEDED:**
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Sklearn
