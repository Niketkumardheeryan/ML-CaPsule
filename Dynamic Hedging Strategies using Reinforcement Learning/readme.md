# Reinforcement Learning Model for Dynamic Hedging Strategies

## Project Description-

This project involves implementing a reinforcement learning (RL) model to develop dynamic hedging strategies for financial derivatives. The objective is to create an adaptive hedging strategy that optimizes the portfolio performance by dynamically adjusting positions based on market conditions.

## Key Objectives-

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather historical market data and preprocess it for analysis.
2. Environment Setup: Create a financial environment that simulates the market for training the RL model.
3. Model Development: Develop and train the RL model using stable-baselines3.
4. Evaluation and Validation: Evaluate the model's performance and validate its effectiveness.
