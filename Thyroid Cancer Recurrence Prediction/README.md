## **Thyroid Recurrence Prediction**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The objective of this project is to predict whether a person is prone to have thyroid again or not, as part of supervised learning to help recognize them.

### ðŸ§µ **Dataset**

The Dataset consists of 17 columns:
| Attribute            | Description                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Age                  | The age of the patient at the time of diagnosis or treatment.                                             |
| Gender               | The gender of the patient (male or female).                                                                |
| Smoking              | Whether the patient is a smoker or not.                                                                   |
| Hx Smoking           | Smoking history of the patient (e.g., whether they have ever smoked).                                      |
| Hx Radiotherapy      | History of radiotherapy treatment for any condition.                                                       |
| Thyroid Function     | The status of thyroid function, possibly indicating if there are any abnormalities.                        |
| Physical Examination | Findings from a physical examination of the patient, which may include palpation of the thyroid gland and surrounding structures. |
| Adenopathy           | Presence or absence of enlarged lymph nodes (adenopathy) in the neck region.                                 |
| Pathology            | Specific types of thyroid cancer as determined by pathology examination of biopsy samples.                   |
| Focality             | Whether the cancer is unifocal (limited to one location) or multifocal (present in multiple locations).     |
| Risk                 | The risk category of the cancer based on various factors, such as tumor size, extent of spread, and histological type. |
| T                    | Tumor classification based on its size and extent of invasion into nearby structures.                        |
| N                    | Nodal classification indicating the involvement of lymph nodes.                                            |
| M                    | Metastasis classification indicating the presence or absence of distant metastases.                         |
| Stage                | The overall stage of the cancer, typically determined by combining T, N, and M classifications.             |
| Response             | Response to treatment, indicating whether the cancer responded positively, negatively, or remained stable after treatment. |
| Recurred             | Indicates whether the cancer has recurred after initial treatment.                                           |

### ðŸ§¾ **Description**

I focused on creating a model proficient in predicting if the patient is prone to have thyroid again or not.

### ðŸ§® **What I had done!**

To achieve our goals we:

- Tested out three different models for performing binary classification on the [Thyroid Recurrence dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/thyroid-disease-data/data).

### ðŸš€ **Models Implemented**

models used:

- Multilayer Perceptron
- TabNet
- WeightedEnsemble_L2

### ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**

- keras
- tensorflow
- pytorch-tabnet
- numpy
- autogluon
- matplotlib

### ðŸ“ˆ **Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores**

Metrics:

| Models | Accuracy |
|--------|---------------------|
| WeightedEnsemble_L2 | 0.9839 |
| MLP | 0.9870 |
| TabNet | 0.9610  |

### ðŸ“¢ **Conclusion**

`WeightedEnsemble_L2` gave the best accuracy i.e, 98.39%.
