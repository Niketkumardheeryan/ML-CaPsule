# Problem Statement
To create Virtual mouse to control computer as well as other hardware devices by means of gesture rather than physical.

# Solution
The proposed system uses nothing more than a in built webcam that acts as a sensor and it is able to track the users hand bearing color caps in two dimensions. The system will be implemented using the python and OpenCV. The hand gesture is the natural way of communication. The output of the camera will be displayed on the monitor. Position or centroid  information about the gesture will be gathered using detection of color. This method mainly focuses on the use of a Web Camera to develop a virtual human computer interaction device in a cost effective manner
