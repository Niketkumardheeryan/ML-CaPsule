,Name,All Critics Reviews,Rotten/Fresh,Date
0,David Walsh,It might be best perhaps to describe Titanic as a sort of lowest common denominator. The film contains certain minimums necessary to draw an audience ... but its very blandness ... accounts for its great success.,rotten,"February 12, 2021"
1,Mike Massie,Stirring music and seamless special effects add to the thrills - it's just a shame it takes so long to get to that point.,fresh,"September 25, 2020"
2,Geoff Brown,"For all the sluggish script and the enormous weight of the special effects, this movie behemoth still has the power to shake us rigid and and touch the soul.",fresh,"February 6, 2020"
3,Nigel Andrews,"[The ending] is a masterpiece of popcorn tragedy: not deep, not sophisticated, barely even credible, but gut-clutching for those of us who have already lost the sensible use of our stomachs, as we would in any worthwhile fairground ride.",fresh,"February 6, 2020"
4,Rachel Wagner,It's the kind of movie that just doesn't come along that often.,fresh,"June 28, 2019"
5,Sean Burns,"In recent years I've come around to thinking that a more nuanced version of the tale with better-rounded characters wouldn't resonate as powerfully as Cameron's shamelessly bold, sometimes silly strokes.",fresh,"June 20, 2019"
6,David Baron,"See Titanic, then, for its success as an outrageous visual stunt -- a marvel of cinematic (and computer) sleight-of-hand. But don't go with any illusions that this soap opera on water is anything but a cartoon melodrama with fairy-tale leads.",fresh,"February 21, 2019"
7,Quentin Curtis,"The movie is a ride, and not without the odd moment of corniness. But it's also about freedom and flight, bondage and stagnation. And most fittingly, as a memorial itself, it's about memory and the act of remembering.",fresh,"February 6, 2019"
8,Duane Byrge,"No meager disaster movie, greased by generic formula and goosed by big-bucks technology... Titanic is one big, bruising movie that will appeal on different levels to different audiences.",fresh,"December 26, 2018"
9,Hannah Ryan,"Titanic has deservedly cemented its place as one of the greatest movies of all time, as it manages to capture the wretchedness of historical tragedy while also skilfully enrapturing us with the dedication shown by one person to another...",fresh,"August 24, 2018"
10,Matthew Sweet,"The dialogue may be unspeakable, but the film remains unsinkable.",fresh,"March 2, 2018"
11,Jack Mathews,"Cameron's aim was to set the most intimate love story possible against one of the century's biggest tragedies, and he very nearly pulls it off. DiCaprio has a captivating presence in a role that might have been written for a young Clark Gable.",fresh,"January 3, 2018"
12,Alissa Wilkinson,"What I can tell you, risking puns, is that it swept me off my feet almost from the get-go, a grand epic romance-disaster that reminded me, in the middle of my overstuffed-with-movies life, of what we mean when we talk about the power of cinema.",fresh,"December 19, 2017"
13,Jason Bailey,"Sure, 'Titanic' may be corny, clumsy, and obvious-but the sincerity of its emotions and the power of its spectacle endure.",fresh,"December 15, 2017"
14,Paul Tatara,"Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
15,Dave Kehr,"If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
16,Desmond Ryan,"The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
17,Maria Schneider,Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.,fresh,"February 25, 2014"
18,Jay Boyar,Titanic is indeed a ship of dreams. Climb aboard and bon voyage.,fresh,"February 25, 2014"
19,Leah Rozen,DiCaprio and Winslet both deliver star-making performances.,fresh,"February 25, 2014"
20,Joe Holleman,"Take one of history's most compelling tragedies, tell it through the lives of two engaging young lovers and show it with some of the best-ever special effects and you have a dazzling, exciting movie that is also poignant and personal.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
21,Serena Donadoni,It's a technically magnificent and emotionally wrenching experience.,fresh,"February 25, 2014"
22,Rod Dreher,"Titanic is an awesome achievement, a traditional Hollywood epic that dazzles your eyes, breaks your heart and shivers your soul.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
23,Chris Knight,DiCaprio manages a good mix of youthful bravado and nervous uncertainty... And Winslet shines as a willful rich girl who discovers her sensual side with this earthy urchin.,fresh,"February 24, 2013"
24,Gene Siskel,"With his beatific, sweet, open face, DiCaprio gives us a rooting interest in hoping that someone important to us survives the wreck.",fresh,"January 16, 2013"
25,Ben Kendrick,Titanic 3D lacks creative synergy that could have been explored had the film been shot with 3D in mind but its easily the best example of post-conversion to date.,fresh,"September 27, 2012"
26,R.L. Shaffer,"A staggering film, layered with melodramatic romance, tragedy, intensity and breathtaking production design.",fresh,"September 26, 2012"
27,Jim Schembri,Jack and Rose actually cause the Titanic to hit the iceberg. Watch closely.,fresh,"September 19, 2012"
28,Felix Vasquez Jr.,Director James Cameron takes one of his most beloved historical incidents and transforms it in to a McDonald's product...,rotten,"September 12, 2012"
29,John J. Puccio,"While I admit the film does not impress me as much as it does most other people, there is no questioning its passion and excitement.",fresh,"September 5, 2012"
30,Kelly Vance,"When the bolts start to pop and the water bursts the bulkheads and the ship's orchestra plays waltzes, writer-director Cameron achieves his vision grandly.",fresh,"May 3, 2012"
31,Charlie Lyne,The most breezy 194 minutes ever to grace the multiplex.,fresh,"April 29, 2012"
32,Blake Howard,"The clunky dialogue, historical inaccuracy and overdose of Billy Zane in the opening stanza of the film is all but forgotten in one of the most emotionally affective, thrilling closing stanzas ever committed to celluloid.",fresh,"April 28, 2012"
33,Linda Cook,"'Titanic' is an epic that's see-worthy indeed. Directed/written/produced by James Cameron, its $200 million budget shows in its glorious effects, dazzling camera work and lavish sets, now, with the addition of Cameron's carefully crafted 3-D.",fresh,"April 21, 2012"
34,Bruce Bennett,"Yes, it is time to return to the chilly North Atlantic to appreciate again James Cameron's glorious epic, for its scope, underappreciated script and perfect casting.",fresh,"April 16, 2012"
35,Victoria Alexander,Two spitting scenes in 3D and Jack Dawson loses his virginity. A second look indicates a cruel streak in the modern epic.,fresh,"April 16, 2012"
36,Brett Michel,Spoiler alert! The ship still sinks.,fresh,"April 14, 2012"
37,Burl Burlingame,"It is, simply, a great film, a throwback to classic filmmaking, and more than that, an experience with unusual resonance to the world of today.",fresh,"April 12, 2012"
38,Rob Humanick,The kind of mass death spectacle Michael Bay is frequently accused (and often guilty) of partaking in is much better encapsulated in Titanic's final third.,fresh,"April 9, 2012"
39,Dan Lybarger,"If you can get past the occasional Cameron clunker (Who can forget, ""I'm the king of the world!"") and Zane's almost amusingly over-the-top turn as Cal, Titanic still manages to make the tragedy seem more vivid than a statistic in a history book.",fresh,"April 8, 2012"
40,Kevin A. Ranson,Forget that we know how it all ends; it's the drama of dealing with eventuality that tells the real story here.,fresh,"April 8, 2012"
41,Michelle Alexandria,"15 years ago, I didn't let Titanic into my heart, now I get it. Movie is fantastic, but utterly fails as a 3D reissue.",rotten,"April 8, 2012"
42,Matt Brunson,"While Titanic can't touch Cameron's true classics, The Terminator and Aliens, it's nevertheless better than Avatar, a surface treat that can't match the emotional pull of this alternately tragic, alternately triumphant tale of two star-crossed lovers.",fresh,"April 7, 2012"
43,Lisa Giles-Keddie,"Simply one of 20th century cinema's greatest, old-fashioned love stories, full of still impressive effects (pre 3D) and decent, if theatrical acting ...",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
44,Todd Gilchrist,"Titanic evidences the secret of his longtime success, a talent more impressive even than Cameron's technical prowess: his ability to find stories that tap into greater truths and deeper feelings.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
45,Ed Whitfield,"Forget women and children, what about truth and realism first?",rotten,"April 6, 2012"
46,Cath Clarke,We know the story ends badly but Cameron still sweeps us up in the romance between Kate Winslet's rebellious posh girl and DiCaprio's steerage kid.,fresh,"April 6, 2012"
47,Norman Wilner,Titanic still works brilliantly; it's a grand-scale studio epic with the heart of a romance and the pulse of an action movie. It's the only American film that rivals Gone With The Wind for both swoonery and production value.,fresh,"April 6, 2012"
48,Alex Zane,Titanic is a movie that has to be seen on the big screen and will enchant a new generation of fans. A must-see 3D experience.,fresh,"April 6, 2012"
49,David Sexton,"It has itself become, like the shipwreck, a cultural monument, only accreting value, not losing significance, as time goes by.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
50,Liverpool Echo Staff,"Cameron hasn't plugged any of the plot holes and some dialogue is still cheesy but now, just as in 1998, we forgive him a multitude of sins.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
51,Dana Stevens,"Cameron's three-hour disaster epic is a triumph of popular art -- of folk art, really.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
52,Rafer Guzman,"""Titanic"" still amazes as the kind of massive, build-and-destroy production that few filmmakers have the ambition or budget to make.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
53,Ann Hornaday,"[Cameron] stages the sinking with a flawless sense of detail, pacing, import and dread.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
54,Alonso Duralde,"For all of its flaws, this movie works in the way that classic Hollywood movies do. It delivers.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
55,Christopher Tookey,Its emotional impact lies in the fact it makes even the most blas of us feel what it must have been like to be on the sinking ship. And the film's underlying themes still have potency.,fresh,"April 5, 2012"
56,Peter Bradshaw,"Only the snobbish or the obtuse could deny its ambition, verve and entertainment firepower.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
57,Joe Morgenstern,This version has deepened and enriched a film that was already rich in emotions and remarkable for its depth of detail.,fresh,"April 5, 2012"
58,Peter Travers,How is Titanic in 3D? The answer is pretty damn dazzling.,fresh,"April 5, 2012"
59,Gary Wolcott,"Those who've only seen it on video don't think the film is that big a deal. Trust me, it is. Even with the dragged out love story, Cameron's film is still mind-blowing.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
60,Brian Orndorf,"Time has been kind to the effort, exposing a strikingly constructed, sporadically numbskulled, exhaustively sentimental feature that sails smoothly with an unobtrusive 3D addition.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
61,Basia Cummings,"If you fancy indulging in pure, unadulterated silliness and spending a night in the '90s, this is a good bet. Otherwise...",rotten,"April 5, 2012"
62,Rich Cline,"Reissued to tie in with the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's ill-fated maiden voyage, it's astonishing how timeless the film looks. And as a true classic, it doesn't lose our attention for a moment.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
63,Adrian Turner,"Titanic is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
64,Michael Phillips,Cameron is a genius at instilling narrative dread and designing a hokum-drenched fairy tale of a certain size.,fresh,"April 5, 2012"
65,Drew McWeeny,"Like the film or don't like the film, there are very few filmmakers working now or ever who could have done what Cameron did here, no matter what resources they had.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
66,L. Thompson,"Near, far, wherever you are sitting in the theater, the newly revamped Titanic now has stuff coming out at you.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
67,Christy Lemire,"If any film should be redone in 3-D, it's ""Titanic."" And if any filmmaker should be the one doing the redoing, it's James Cameron.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
68,Henry Fitzherbert,"A timeless epic that gets me every time (yes, I needed my own life raft at the screening), the power of the storytelling and the performances by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio grip throughout.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
69,Josh Forward,It's so easy to see how this film that's still so enjoyable from start to end has become so iconic.,fresh,"April 4, 2012"
70,Michael Simms,"Revisiting Titanic on the big screen, this time in impressive 3D, is a welcome reminder of solid blockbuster movie magic.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
71,Gary Thompson,The central love story involving steerage passenger Leonardo DiCaprio and rich girl Kate Winslet has lost none of its luster - metaphorically speaking.,fresh,"April 4, 2012"
72,Philip De Semlyen,"With a 3D conversion from the medium's pioneer-in-chief, Titanic is a big-screen romance that's every bit as epic as you remember.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
73,Graham Young,It's for old-fashioned romantics who want to see a classic love story on the grandest scale.,fresh,"April 4, 2012"
74,Simon Reynolds,"It's certainly a jaw-dropping big screen experience, even though the outcome is never in doubt. Just make sure you bolt for the door once Celine Dion's caterwauling kicks in.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
75,Matthew Turner,"A thoroughly gripping, emotionally powerful, genuinely thrilling and, yes, achingly romantic drama with jaw-dropping special effects and star-making performances from DiCaprio and Winslet.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
76,Rob Thomas,"""Titanic 3D"" works because it's still ""Titanic,"" a satisfying merger of newfangled effects and oldfangled melodrama. Judging by the wave of sniffles at the sneak preview screening I saw Tuesday night, it's a formula that endures 15 years later.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
77,R. Kurt Osenlund,"The re-release is keenly timed with the 100th anniversary of the actual sinking of the RMS Titanic, yet another factor to validate the 3D film's existence.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
78,Claudia Puig,"Sure, it's corny, but there's something endearing about the tale of young love and its earnest lack of irony.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
79,Emma Dibdin,"Leo and Kate give good doomed romance but it's the human horror of the collision, botched evacuation and final sinking that devastates most.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
80,Robbie Collin,"Cameron's detractors grouse about his use of scale and spectacle to invest archetypal, even clichd stories with an extra, unearned emotional significance. They're absolutely right, with one crucial caveat: there's absolutely nothing unearned about it.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
81,Joe Neumaier,"Like Kathy Bates' ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, ""Titanic"" is unabashedly American: It's big, brash and sometimes gauche, yet also unapologetically earnest, amazing to look at and devoted to its own cause. And it knows how to win us over.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
82,Liam Lacey,"Overall, for a blockbuster movie about one great big thing hitting another great big thing, the new film shows distinctly upper-deck restraint.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
83,Peter Howell,"The letdown factor has been most keenly felt in conversions from 2D, but Titanic 3D shows how the ambition can be realized if the will and skill are there. We can only hope that other filmmakers follow Cameron's example.",fresh,"April 3, 2012"
84,Nick Pinkerton,"But the power of Titanic didn't come from originality; it came from punching clichs across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, ""old-fashioned,"" or plain corny, depending on your perspective.",fresh,"April 3, 2012"
85,Lou Lumenick,"James Cameron's spectacular new 3-D version of ""Titanic'' is everything I'd hoped for, and more.",fresh,"April 3, 2012"
86,Roger Moore,"I found the length tedious, some of the dialogue eye-rolling and some of the digital effects lacking (the digital ship's digital wake seemed puny) when ""Titanic"" first came out. But those quibbles fade with time.",fresh,"April 2, 2012"
87,Rene Rodriguez,"Here is a rare opportunity to return to something you once loved, and discover it still holds up, no apologies necessary.",fresh,"April 2, 2012"
88,Scott A. Mantz,"Still a spectacular cinematic experience that, if nothing else, will remind moviegoers why they fell in love with it in the first place.",fresh,"April 2, 2012"
89,Ed Gibbs,"A modern-day take on the classic Hollywood romance, delivered with the kind of panache long thought lost to the sands of time, that proves essentially timeless.",fresh,"April 1, 2012"
90,Paul Byrnes,"Turns out hubris and greed float, like sorrow.",fresh,"March 28, 2012"
91,Laura Clifford,"The unprecedented special effects...never overpower the fictional love story and historical human tragedy which are presented. It's not only awe-inspiring, it's surprisingly moving.",fresh,"March 26, 2012"
92,JimmyO,"As dreadful as another post conversion of a blockbuster may sound, this is as good as it gets",fresh,"February 16, 2012"
93,Sandie Angulo Chen,"Great movie, but not appropriate for all kids.",fresh,"December 31, 2010"
94,Tim Brayton,"Exactly what it says on the label: a deliciously overwrought melodramatic love story, capped off with one of the greatest special effects achievements of the 1990s.",fresh,"December 18, 2009"
95,Josh Larsen,Feeling dispassionate about Titanic is a bit like being stranded alone on the North Atlantic.,fresh,"December 14, 2009"
96,Louise Keller,"Extravagant, exhilarating, devastating, poetic, romantic and totally unforgettable, Titanic is an extraordinary achievement in film making, where technology astounds, yet the human story shines even brighter",fresh,"October 3, 2008"
97,Andrew L. Urban,"You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.",fresh,"October 3, 2008"
98,David Edelstein,Now it can be told: The Titanic went down because of two distracting smoochers on the poop deck.,rotten,"January 29, 2008"
99,Todd McCarthy,"In the end, Cameron's monumental epic still prises open the tear ducts.",fresh,"January 29, 2008"
100,Desson Thomson,A spectacular demonstration of what modern technology can contribute to dramatic storytelling.,fresh,"January 29, 2008"
101,Stephen Hunter,"Titanic is a good, often stunning movie caught in a three-and-a-half hour drift.",rotten,"January 29, 2008"
102,David Ansen,This is Cameron at his best.,fresh,"January 29, 2008"
103,Emanuel Levy,"Titanic is big, bold, touchingly uncynical filmmaking.",fresh,"January 29, 2008"
104,Gary Brown,"Cameron skillfully applies sophisticated special effects to classic American storytelling, resulting in a winning combination of a tale that's modern and old-fashioned, delivering the goods expected of the disaster genre.",fresh,"September 18, 2007"
105,Andrew Sarris,There is nothing to dislike about this film.,fresh,"May 22, 2007"
106,Steven D. Greydanus,Titanic runs well enough in the backstretch of intrigue and contrivance to cross the finish line well ahead of all but a few of the screen's superspectacles in this century.,fresh,"April 27, 2007"
107,Geoff Andrew,"Perhaps the most melancholy thing about Titanic is its celebration of romantic ideals to the exclusion of such self-denying virtues as honor, duty, and heroism.",rotten,"October 27, 2006"
108,Jeffrey M. Anderson,"Cost: well over $200m. Disregarding the ethics of such expenditure on a film, this unprecedented extravagance has not resulted in sophisticated or even very satisfying storytelling.",rotten,"February 9, 2006"
109,Douglas Pratt,"A brilliantly designed, but emotionally shallow romance set during the infamous sinking of the luxury liner in 1912.",fresh,"January 27, 2006"
110,Eric Henderson,A grand and classy production.,fresh,"December 6, 2005"
111,Robin Clifford,It's something of an ingenuous revision of the standard disaster movie.,fresh,"October 23, 2005"
112,Sky Staff,An enormous technical achievement with a wonderfully big heart.,fresh,"April 9, 2005"
113,Jeffrey Overstreet,Titanic is some big movie.,fresh,"February 14, 2005"
114,Martin Scribbs,"The spectacle of the ship will enchant you, and the tragedy of the victims will haunt you for many days after you've seen it.",fresh,"January 15, 2005"
115,Dragan Antulov,Abyss-mal.,rotten,"July 23, 2004"

117,John R. McEwen,,fresh,"May 14, 2003"
118,Nick Davis,"The plot before the collision is almost dispensable, but from that moment on, it is absolutely riveting.",fresh,"February 8, 2003"
119,Chris Gore,"Yes, Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater are flimsyish characters, but DiCaprio and Winslet still have the formidable challenge as actors to gauge the levels of their performances against the galvanizing visual and technotronic aspects of the film.",fresh,"January 10, 2003"
120,Margaret A. McGurk,The film is the best of the year.,fresh,"December 8, 2002"

125,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,The film's long final phase is a harrowing series of sublime images of death and those about to die.,fresh,"March 24, 2002"
126,Brandon Judell,The finale is a special effects dazzler but those scenes pale in comparison to the dramatic and creative ways Cameron exalts the salvific power of love.,fresh,"March 2, 2002"

131,Robert Roten,"A hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances, a movie that reeks of phoniness and lacks even minimal originality.",rotten,"February 14, 2001"
132,Barbara Shulgasser,This is a fine example of Hollywood filmmaking. This is a studio film in the best sense of the word.,fresh,"January 1, 2001"
133,Maitland McDonagh,Titanic is awash in truncated subplots.,rotten,"January 1, 2000"
134,Jay Carr,"The drama is cliched, if competently effective, but Cameron's dissolves from the Titanic's rusted hulk to her brand spanking new decks are breathtaking, even poetic.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"

147,Roger Ebert,But what's most impressive about Titanic is the evidence it shows of new maturity in Cameron's filmmaking priorities.,fresh,"January 1, 2000"
148,Michael Wilmington,"James Cameron's 194-minute, $200 million film of the tragic voyage is in the tradition of the great Hollywood epics. It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted and spellbinding.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
