3. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features that could impact crude oil prices.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected models on historical data.
6. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
7. **Prediction**: Use trained models to forecast future crude oil prices.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

- Utilized datasets (e.g., CSV files) containing historical crude oil prices.
- Handled missing data and outliers appropriately.

### Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling null values.
- Normalized the data using `MinMaxScaler` for better model performance.

### Feature Engineering

- Created time-based features (e.g., moving averages, lagged values).
- Included relevant external factors that could influence crude oil prices.

### Model Selection

- Selected a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model due to its effectiveness in time-series prediction.

### Model Training

- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Trained the RNN model using historical data with a sequence length of 10 time steps.

### Evaluation

## Conclusion

This project effectively predicts crude oil prices using a SimpleRNN model. Key steps included thorough data preparation through cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, which significantly enhanced model performance. The SimpleRNN model was chosen for its ability to capture temporal patterns in the data. Model evaluation using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ², along with residual analysis, validated its accuracy and reliability. A feature ablation study identified the most influential factors, providing valuable insights into price drivers. Visualizations, including time-series plots and feature importance charts, played a crucial role in interpreting the model's performance. Overall, the project highlights the importance of comprehensive data preparation, model selection, and evaluation in time-series forecasting.
