# Pension Fund Optimization with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing pension fund portfolios using deep learning techniques. The system employs Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze financial data and enhance pension fund performance.

## Objectives

- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess financial data relevant to pension fund investments.
- **Model Development**: Build and train deep learning models (MLP, CNN, RNN) to optimize pension fund portfolios.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and portfolio optimization effectiveness.
- **Optimization**: Recommend optimal investment strategies for pension funds based on model predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Additional machine learning tools.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
