0,Geoff Brown,"For all the sluggish script and the enormous weight of the special effects, this movie behemoth still has the power to shake us rigid and and touch the soul.",fresh,"February 6, 2020"
1,Nigel Andrews,"[The ending] is a masterpiece of popcorn tragedy: not deep, not sophisticated, barely even credible, but gut-clutching for those of us who have already lost the sensible use of our stomachs, as we would in any worthwhile fairground ride.",fresh,"February 6, 2020"
2,Quentin Curtis,"The movie is a ride, and not without the odd moment of corniness. But it's also about freedom and flight, bondage and stagnation. And most fittingly, as a memorial itself, it's about memory and the act of remembering.",fresh,"February 6, 2019"
3,Duane Byrge,"No meager disaster movie, greased by generic formula and goosed by big-bucks technology... Titanic is one big, bruising movie that will appeal on different levels to different audiences.",fresh,"December 26, 2018"
4,Jack Mathews,"Cameron's aim was to set the most intimate love story possible against one of the century's biggest tragedies, and he very nearly pulls it off. DiCaprio has a captivating presence in a role that might have been written for a young Clark Gable.",fresh,"January 3, 2018"
5,Alissa Wilkinson,"What I can tell you, risking puns, is that it swept me off my feet almost from the get-go, a grand epic romance-disaster that reminded me, in the middle of my overstuffed-with-movies life, of what we mean when we talk about the power of cinema.",fresh,"December 19, 2017"
6,Jason Bailey,"Sure, 'Titanic' may be corny, clumsy, and obvious-but the sincerity of its emotions and the power of its spectacle endure.",fresh,"December 15, 2017"
7,Paul Tatara,"Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
8,Dave Kehr,"If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
9,Desmond Ryan,"The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
10,Maria Schneider,Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.,fresh,"February 25, 2014"
11,Jay Boyar,Titanic is indeed a ship of dreams. Climb aboard and bon voyage.,fresh,"February 25, 2014"
12,Joe Holleman,"Take one of history's most compelling tragedies, tell it through the lives of two engaging young lovers and show it with some of the best-ever special effects and you have a dazzling, exciting movie that is also poignant and personal.",fresh,"February 25, 2014"
13,Gene Siskel,"With his beatific, sweet, open face, DiCaprio gives us a rooting interest in hoping that someone important to us survives the wreck.",fresh,"January 16, 2013"
14,Cath Clarke,We know the story ends badly but Cameron still sweeps us up in the romance between Kate Winslet's rebellious posh girl and DiCaprio's steerage kid.,fresh,"April 6, 2012"
15,David Sexton,"It has itself become, like the shipwreck, a cultural monument, only accreting value, not losing significance, as time goes by.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
16,Dana Stevens,"Cameron's three-hour disaster epic is a triumph of popular art -- of folk art, really.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
17,Rafer Guzman,"""Titanic"" still amazes as the kind of massive, build-and-destroy production that few filmmakers have the ambition or budget to make.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
18,Ann Hornaday,"[Cameron] stages the sinking with a flawless sense of detail, pacing, import and dread.",fresh,"April 6, 2012"
19,Alonso Duralde,"For all of its flaws, this movie works in the way that classic Hollywood movies do. It delivers.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
20,Peter Bradshaw,"Only the snobbish or the obtuse could deny its ambition, verve and entertainment firepower.",fresh,"April 5, 2012"
21,Joe Morgenstern,This version has deepened and enriched a film that was already rich in emotions and remarkable for its depth of detail.,fresh,"April 5, 2012"
22,Peter Travers,How is Titanic in 3D? The answer is pretty damn dazzling.,fresh,"April 5, 2012"
23,Basia Cummings,"If you fancy indulging in pure, unadulterated silliness and spending a night in the '90s, this is a good bet. Otherwise...",rotten,"April 5, 2012"
24,Michael Phillips,Cameron is a genius at instilling narrative dread and designing a hokum-drenched fairy tale of a certain size.,fresh,"April 5, 2012"
25,Christy Lemire,"If any film should be redone in 3-D, it's ""Titanic."" And if any filmmaker should be the one doing the redoing, it's James Cameron.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
26,Philip De Semlyen,"With a 3D conversion from the medium's pioneer-in-chief, Titanic is a big-screen romance that's every bit as epic as you remember.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
27,R. Kurt Osenlund,"The re-release is keenly timed with the 100th anniversary of the actual sinking of the RMS Titanic, yet another factor to validate the 3D film's existence.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
28,Claudia Puig,"Sure, it's corny, but there's something endearing about the tale of young love and its earnest lack of irony.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
29,Robbie Collin,"Cameron's detractors grouse about his use of scale and spectacle to invest archetypal, even clichd stories with an extra, unearned emotional significance. They're absolutely right, with one crucial caveat: there's absolutely nothing unearned about it.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
30,Joe Neumaier,"Like Kathy Bates' ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, ""Titanic"" is unabashedly American: It's big, brash and sometimes gauche, yet also unapologetically earnest, amazing to look at and devoted to its own cause. And it knows how to win us over.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
31,Liam Lacey,"Overall, for a blockbuster movie about one great big thing hitting another great big thing, the new film shows distinctly upper-deck restraint.",fresh,"April 4, 2012"
32,Peter Howell,"The letdown factor has been most keenly felt in conversions from 2D, but Titanic 3D shows how the ambition can be realized if the will and skill are there. We can only hope that other filmmakers follow Cameron's example.",fresh,"April 3, 2012"
33,Nick Pinkerton,"But the power of Titanic didn't come from originality; it came from punching clichs across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, ""old-fashioned,"" or plain corny, depending on your perspective.",fresh,"April 3, 2012"
34,Lou Lumenick,"James Cameron's spectacular new 3-D version of ""Titanic'' is everything I'd hoped for, and more.",fresh,"April 3, 2012"
35,Rene Rodriguez,"Here is a rare opportunity to return to something you once loved, and discover it still holds up, no apologies necessary.",fresh,"April 2, 2012"
36,Paul Byrnes,"Turns out hubris and greed float, like sorrow.",fresh,"March 28, 2012"
37,David Edelstein,Now it can be told: The Titanic went down because of two distracting smoochers on the poop deck.,rotten,"January 29, 2008"
38,Todd McCarthy,A spectacular demonstration of what modern technology can contribute to dramatic storytelling.,fresh,"January 29, 2008"
39,Desson Thomson,"Titanic is a good, often stunning movie caught in a three-and-a-half hour drift.",rotten,"January 29, 2008"
40,Stephen Hunter,This is Cameron at his best.,fresh,"January 29, 2008"
41,David Ansen,"Titanic is big, bold, touchingly uncynical filmmaking.",fresh,"January 29, 2008"
42,Andrew Sarris,Titanic runs well enough in the backstretch of intrigue and contrivance to cross the finish line well ahead of all but a few of the screen's superspectacles in this century.,fresh,"April 27, 2007"
43,Steven D. Greydanus,"Perhaps the most melancholy thing about Titanic is its celebration of romantic ideals to the exclusion of such self-denying virtues as honor, duty, and heroism.",rotten,"October 27, 2006"
44,Geoff Andrew,"Cost: well over $200m. Disregarding the ethics of such expenditure on a film, this unprecedented extravagance has not resulted in sophisticated or even very satisfying storytelling.",rotten,"February 9, 2006"
45,Douglas Pratt,A grand and classy production.,fresh,"December 6, 2005"
46,Eric Henderson,It's something of an ingenuous revision of the standard disaster movie.,fresh,"October 23, 2005"
47,Rick Groen,Titanic is awesome even when it's awful -- you can't take your eyes off the extraordinary thing.,fresh,"April 12, 2002"
48,Almar Haflidason,Despite its failings it's hard not to become swept up in the sheer grandeur of Titanic.,fresh,"April 17, 2001"
49,Kenneth Turan,"A hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances, a movie that reeks of phoniness and lacks even minimal originality.",rotten,"February 14, 2001"
50,Jay Carr,"Titanic is big-budget spectacle and director Cameron brings it off with high-tech bravura, placing us aboard the ship in real time.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
51,Mike Clark,"Credit Cameron for locating that latitude-longitude spot where haunting loss intersects with sheer cinematic braggadocio. His movie may not be perfect, but visually and viscerally, it pretty well is.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
52,James Berardinelli,"You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
53,Marc Savlov,"It's still by far and away a grand, gorgeous, breathtaking spectacle.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
54,John Hartl,"No other film has made the horror of the ship's sinking so palpable, and none other has dared to dramatize the night of the living dead that followed after it sank beneath the North Atlantic.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
55,Stephanie Zacharek,Glub glub glub.,rotten,"January 1, 2000"
56,Jonathan Rosenbaum,"All things considered, Titanic is old-fashioned epic filmmaking that carries a wallop.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
57,Roger Ebert,"James Cameron's 194-minute, $200 million film of the tragic voyage is in the tradition of the great Hollywood epics. It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted and spellbinding.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
58,Michael Wilmington,"Titanic is a film that sweeps us away into a world of spectacle, beauty and excitement.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
59,Owen Gleiberman,A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom.,fresh,"January 1, 2000"
60,Janet Maslin,"Cameron succeeds magically in linking his film's young lovers, played enchantingly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
61,Nell Minow,The movie raises important questions about choices faced by the characters.,fresh,"January 1, 2000"
62,Adam Smith,"James Cameron has gone and delivered a spectacular, moving, utterly engrossing three-and-a-bit hour epic.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
63,Jeff Millar,Titanic will give you your money's worth.,fresh,"January 1, 2000"
64,Tom Keogh,The would-be emotional centerpiece of his three-hours-plus adventure flick is the most juvenile romantic tale of 1997.,rotten,"January 1, 2000"
65,Peter Rainer,There's a lot to like here.,fresh,"January 1, 2000"
66,Peter Brunette,The disaster is definitely worth the wait.,fresh,"January 1, 2000"
67,Stanley Kauffmann,"Bursting through gaps in the hull, rushing down corridors, licking at rooms, triumphing over great ballrooms and tiny closets, down stairways and into elevators, the sea, in the hands of Cameron and his technical associates, becomes hungry, vindictive.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
68,Robert Horton,"Like it or hate it, Titanic lives and breathes as a piece of pure cinema.",fresh,"January 1, 2000"
69,Susan Stark,"As spectacle, Titanic sets a new standard; as romantic drama, it's substandard.",rotten,"January 1, 2000"

71,Richard Corliss,The regretful verdict here: dead in the water.,rotten,"January 1, 2000"
