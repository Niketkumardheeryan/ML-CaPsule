# Hand Control System

## Overview
The **Hand Control System** is an innovative application that utilizes computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control various features of a computer, such as brightness, volume, and mouse functionality. By leveraging the power of MediaPipe and OpenCV, this project allows users to interact with their devices in a touchless manner.

## Features
- **Brightness Control**: Adjust the screen brightness using hand gestures.
- **Volume Control**: Control audio volume with simple hand movements.
- **Virtual Mouse**: Use hand gestures to emulate mouse movements and clicks.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Zoom in and out on screen content with specific gestures.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter for GUI
- OpenCV for image processing
- MediaPipe for hand tracking
- Pycaw for audio control
- Additional libraries: `google.protobuf`, `threading`, `cv2`, `mediapipe`

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
