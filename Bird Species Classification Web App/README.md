## PROJECT TITLE : BIRDS SPECIES CLASSIFICATION

#### AIM

To classify the different species of bird

#### DESCRIPTION

This is a classification problem where we need to classify the different species of birds. We use Xception Transfer Learning Model.

#### DEPLOYMENT

StreamLit-Share = Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in Python. No front‑end experience required. Streamlit’s open-source app framework is a breeze to get started with. It is very easy to use. One just have to connect with the github repo and start deploying it on streamlit share and you are good to go.

#### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras
4. Xception
5. Glob
6. StreamLit

#### CONCLUSION

We can conclude that our Web App classifies bird species with the help of Xception Tranfer Learning library.
