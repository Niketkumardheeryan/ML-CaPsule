# Drowsiness Detection 

A project for Drowsiess Detection in Python, using OpenCV and YOLO. We use the device camera to train the custom model for images and classifying them as 'awake' or 'drowsy', which is used for future live prediction.


## Major Libraries Used:

- Yolov5
- LabelImg
- OpenCV
- Pytorch
- Numpy
- Matplotlib



## Implementation

To implement this project:

```bash
  Run Jupyter Notebooks using jupyter notebook in cmd and run the code. Make a folder in your preferred directory for data and images and set the absolute address accordingly. 
```
