#### DEPLOYMENT

StreamLit-Share = Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in Python. No front‑end experience required. Streamlit’s open-source app framework is a breeze to get started with. It is very easy to use. One just have to connect with the github repo and start deploying it on streamlit share and you are good to go.

#### LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Keras
4. Xception
5. Glob
6. StreamLit

#### CONCLUSION

We can conclude that our Web App classifies bird species with the help of Xception Tranfer Learning library.
