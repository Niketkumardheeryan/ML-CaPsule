Statistical modeling in python
Statistical modeling is the process of using statistical techniques to describe and understand the relationships between variables in a dataset. It involves the formulation of mathematical models that represent the underlying structure of the data, allowing for inference, prediction, and hypothesis testing.

Data Collection-
kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset
About dataset :
Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction, allowing tracking and reference.

Date: The date when the transaction occurred, providing insights into sales trends over time.
