PROJECT TITLE

Bitcoin Price Prediction

GOAL

Aim- To predict the price of the Bitcoin using  Lasso Regression. Perform EDA

DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem where we need to predict the price of Bitcoin. We use Lasso Regression 

WHAT I HAD DONE

1. perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. it starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
3. we calculate statistical data in the dataset
4. then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
5. data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
6. finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
7. also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms

MODELS USED

Lasso Regression - 99 % accuracy

DEPLOYMENT

StreamLit-Share = Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in Python. No front‑end experience required. Streamlit’s open-source app framework is a breeze to get started with. It is very easy to use. One just have to connect with the github repo and start deploying it on streamlit share and you are good to go.


LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-Learn
6. StreamLit


CONCLUSION

We can conclude that our Web App predicts the best with  Lasso Regression and gives the most accurate results.
