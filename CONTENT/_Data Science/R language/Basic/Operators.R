# The operators act on each element of the vector

#Assign twwo vector
> v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
> t <- c(8, 3, 4)

#Addition
> c= t+v

# Substraction
> d = c-t

# Multiplication
> e = c*t

# Division that is divide the first vector with the second
> f = c/t

#Give the remainder of the first vector with the second
> g = c%%t

#The result of division of first vector with second (quotient)
>h = c%/%t

# Raise to power
> i = v^t

'''Other operator like logical and relational are similar to other programming language'''
