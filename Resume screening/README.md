# Resume Screening using NLP
For each recruitment, companies receive numerous resumes through online ads and referrals. Manually screening thousands of resumes is time-consuming and inefficient. By automating resume screening with machine learning, we can significantly reduce the time and effort required, allowing hiring teams to focus on the best candidates.


## Goal
Resume screening involves selecting the best candidates for a job based on their resumes. This process is critical for business growth as it ensures the right talent is hired. Due to the high volume of resumes, many companies outsource this task, which can be costly. Using machine learning, companies can perform resume screening in-house efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset which is used in this project, is collected from Kaggle. Here is the link of the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset

## What Have I done
1. Loading and importing all the libraries.
2. Importing the dataset in the Jupyter Notebook.
3. These are following steps - 
    - Exploratory Data Analysis
       - Data pre-processing
       - Data Modeling (with Training/Test Data)
       - Learining the top keywords across resumes.
4. Conclusion

## Conclusion
**we learned how machine learning and Natural Language Processing can be applied to improve our day-to-day life through the example of Resume Screening. We just classified almost 1000 resumes in few minutes into their respective categories with 99% accuracy.**
