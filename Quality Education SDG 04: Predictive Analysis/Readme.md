# Enhancing Quality Education in India Through Data-Driven Insights

## Project Description

This project aims to improve the quality of education in India by leveraging data analysis to identify gaps and opportunities within the educational system. Our goal is to ensure inclusive and equitable education for all, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4: Quality Education).

## Problem Statement

Despite progress in Indian education, challenges such as inequality, resource scarcity, and inadequate teaching methods persist, especially in marginalized communities. These issues are compounded by a lack of data-driven insights to inform policy and practice. This project seeks to address these challenges through comprehensive data analysis.

## Objectives

- Ensure all children complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education by 2030.
- Provide access to quality early childhood education.
- Ensure equal access to technical and vocational education.
- Increase youth and adult skills for employment and entrepreneurship.
- Eliminate gender disparities and ensure equal educational access for vulnerable groups.
- Achieve literacy and numeracy for all youth and a significant proportion of adults.
- Equip learners with skills for sustainable development and global citizenship.
