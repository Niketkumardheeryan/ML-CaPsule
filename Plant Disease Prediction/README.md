# Tomato Plant Disease Detection using TinyML

## Description
This project develops a lightweight machine learning model using TinyML techniques to detect tomato plant diseases from leaf images in real-time. By leveraging TensorFlow Lite and Edge Impulse, the model runs directly on edge devices, providing immediate insights for agricultural decision-making. With a dataset of 16,011 images across 10 disease categories, the model undergoes rigorous preprocessing, augmentation, and optimization. Real-world testing validates its effectiveness, offering farmers a convenient tool for on-site disease diagnosis, potentially revolutionizing agricultural practices.
