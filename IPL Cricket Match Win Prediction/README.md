# IPL Cricket Match Win Probability Prediction using LGBM Classifier

## Overview

This project predicts the win probability of an IPL cricket match using the LightGBM classifier. The system analyzes ball-by-ball data to determine which team is more likely to win at any point during the match. This predictive model is valuable for fans, analysts, and stakeholders interested in real-time match insights.

## Objectives

- Data Processing: Clean and preprocess ball-by-ball IPL match data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extract meaningful features from the data that influence match outcomes.
- Model Development: Develop and train the LightGBM classifier to predict match outcomes.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
- Optimization: Generate visual charts to analyze model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language for development.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Numerical computing.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning tools for building and evaluating models.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
- LightGBM: Framework for building and training the LGBM Classifier.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.

## Models

### LightGBM Classifier
- *Purpose*: Predict the winner of IPL cricket matches based on historical data.
- *Architecture*: Gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms to handle categorical and continuous features, optimizing performance aprediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning models, specifically the LightGBM classifier, can be applied to sports analytics, providing real-time predictions and insights into cricket matches. The integration of detailed data processing, model training, and visualization tools offers a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting IPL match outcomes.
