# Company Bankruptcy Prediction Using KMeans and DBSCAN

This project aims to predict company bankruptcy using clustering algorithms such as KMeans and DBSCAN. The goal is to group companies based on their financial data and identify patterns that might indicate bankruptcy risk.

## Table of Contents

Data Preprocessing:
to clean and prepare the data.
Feature Engineering:
to create features for the clustering algorithms.
KMeans Clustering:
to apply KMeans clustering on the dataset.
DBSCAN Clustering:
to apply DBSCAN clustering on the dataset.
Model Evaluation:
to evaluate the performance of the clustering models.

## Introduction

Predicting company bankruptcy is essential for investors, creditors, and regulatory authorities. This project uses clustering algorithms to analyze financial data and identify groups of companies with similar characteristics, which can be used to predict bankruptcy risk.
