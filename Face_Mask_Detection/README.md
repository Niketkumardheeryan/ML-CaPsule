# Face Mask Detection

This project involves building a face detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras. The model is designed to classify images into two classes: whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers, with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
