## **Conclusions:** ##

* Most of the Machine Learning Learners and Professionals are from Nigria.

* Most of them are following no one as shown in the bar graph above.

* Very less people have huge followers.

* Maximum of them are having zero followers.

* There are many ML users from Nigeria, it shows that Nigerians are more interested in ML.
