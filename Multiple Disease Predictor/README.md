# Multi-Disease Prediction Application

## Overview

These models aim to predict multiple types of diseases simultaneously, including diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and comprehensive medical data, these models provide users with early warnings and actionable insights to manage their health proactively.

## Use Case: Multi-Disease Prediction

### Diabetes Prediction
Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs such as:

- Glucose levels
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Age
- Family history
 
### Heart Disease Assessment
Assesses the risk of heart disease using parameters like:

- Cholesterol levels
- Blood pressure
- Smoking status
- Physical activity

### Kidney Disease Evaluation
Evaluates the possibility of kidney disease by analyzing factors such as:

- Blood creatinine levels
- Urine albumin levels
- Hypertension
