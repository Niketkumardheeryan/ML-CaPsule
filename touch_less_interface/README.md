Hand Control System
This project is a touchless hand control system that uses computer vision to control screen brightness, volume, zoom, and a virtual mouse using hand gestures. The system is implemented using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Tkinter to capture and process gestures via a webcam.

Features
Brightness Control: Control screen brightness with left-hand gestures.

Volume Control: Adjust system volume using gestures with the right hand.

Zoom Control: Zoom in and out with hand gestures for easy screen navigation.

Virtual Mouse: Move the cursor and perform clicks with a virtual mouse controlled by gestures.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe google protobuf pycaw comtypes
File Structure
main.py: Main script that sets up the GUI and handles gesture recognition.
brightnes_lefthand.py: Controls screen brightness using left-hand gestures.
volume_control_righthand.py: Adjusts system volume with right-hand gestures.
zoominout.py: Implements zoom control functionality.
virtualmouse.py: Manages virtual mouse behavior.
How It Works
Hand Detection: The system uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks via a webcam feed, capturing the handâ€™s position and orientation in real-time.

Gesture Recognition:

Left Hand: Controls brightness and zoom functions.
Right Hand: Controls volume and the virtual mouse.
Custom GUI: A Tkinter-based GUI with 3D-looking buttons allows you to start and stop gesture-based controls easily.

Gesture Details
Left Hand: Gestures for brightness and zoom control are processed, identifying specific finger configurations.
Right Hand: Detects volume control gestures based on hand landmark distances and uses pointer movements for virtual mouse control.
Usage
Run the Program: Run the main program by executing:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Controls:

Start Control: Click on "B/V Control" to start the webcam and enable gesture-based control.
Stop Control: Click on "Stop Control" to close the webcam feed and stop gesture recognition.
Customization
You can modify or add gestures by updating the process_video function in main.py. This function processes hand landmarks to detect gestures and perform specific actions. To add new controls, create additional classes or functions and call them within the process_video function.

Applications
The touchless hand control system can be applied in:

Touchless computer screen control setups for hygiene-sensitive environments.
Remote control applications for presentations.
Accessibility tools for individuals with mobility challenges.

The gesture recognition is implemented using the MediaPipe Hands API for detecting hand landmarks and hand gestures in real-time.
