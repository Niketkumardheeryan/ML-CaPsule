## **Thyroid Recurrence Prediction**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The objective of this project is to predict whether a person is prone to have thyroid again or not, as part of supervised learning to help recognize them.

## Overview

The **Thyroid Recurrence Prediction** project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of thyroid cancer recurrence. By leveraging supervised learning techniques, the project seeks to enhance early detection and management strategies, thereby improving patient outcomes and guiding clinical decisions.

## Objectives

- **Predict Thyroid Recurrence:** Develop a model to predict whether a patient is prone to thyroid cancer recurrence based on various features.
- **Compare Model Performance:** Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models to determine the most accurate and effective approach.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes patient information and clinical data with the following attributes:

- **Age:** Age of the patient at diagnosis or treatment.
- **Gender:** Gender of the patient.
- **Smoking:** Smoking status of the patient.
- **Hx Smoking:** Smoking history.
- **Hx Radiotherapy:** History of radiotherapy treatment.
- **Thyroid Function:** Status of thyroid function.
- **Physical Examination:** Findings from physical examination.
- **Adenopathy:** Presence of enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.
- **Pathology:** Types of thyroid cancer based on biopsy.
- **Focality:** Whether the cancer is unifocal or multifocal.
- **Risk:** Risk category of cancer based on tumor characteristics.
- **T, N, M:** Tumor, nodal, and metastasis classifications.
- **Stage:** Overall stage of the cancer.
- **Response:** Response to treatment.
- **Recurred:** Indicator of cancer recurrence.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.
2. **Model Selection:** Three different models were implemented:
   - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):** A neural network model that learns complex patterns in data.
   - **TabNet:** A deep learning model designed for tabular data, combining attention mechanisms with decision trees.
   - **WeightedEnsemble_L2:** An ensemble learning approach that combines predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.
3. **Evaluation:** Each model was evaluated based on accuracy scores to determine its effectiveness in predicting thyroid recurrence.
