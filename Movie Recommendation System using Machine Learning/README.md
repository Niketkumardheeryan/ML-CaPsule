# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This system utilizes machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.

## Overview

This project aims to enhance user experience by suggesting movies tailored to individual tastes. By analyzing user behavior, preferences, and similarities between movies, the recommendation system suggests relevant films that users are likely to enjoy.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: The system offers personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history.
- **User Profiles**: Users can create profiles and update their preferences to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: The system employs collaborative filtering techniques to identify similar users and recommend movies based on their preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Additionally, the system utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their attributes and characteristics.
- **Scalability**: The recommendation algorithm is designed to handle large datasets and scale efficiently as the user base grows.
- **Integration**: The system can be integrated into various platforms, including streaming services, movie databases, and e-commerce websites.
