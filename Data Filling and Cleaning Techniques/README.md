# Data Filling and Cleaning Techniques

1. Dropping Row/Column -> Having more than 15% or 20% missing data <br>
2. Measure Central Tendency -> Mean/Median <br>
3. Measure Central Tendency for Each Class -> Mean & Median<br>
4. Measure Central Tendency for Each Class -> Mode <br>
5. SimpleImputer -> Scikit Learn Module <br>
6. ColumnTransformer & Pipeline -> Scikit Learn Module <br>
7. KNN imputer (resulted in more accuracy than simple imputer) -> Scikit Learn Module <br>
8. One hot Encoding (Especially for categorical columns) <br>
9. Random sample Imputation
    
### Note : You can execute the KNN imputer and random sample imputation notebooks by using the train.csv files
