# Road Accident Analysis report

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard for data related to road safety. It is expected of you to examine the dataset, find any gaps in the data, clean up the data, and create a Power BI visualisation of the data. For their coding round research internship at Cistup, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore provided this dataset.

### Note : You can also take a look of the interactive dashboard by downloading the dataset providing in this repository and uploading .pbit file on the Power BI desktop app. Just ensure you have uploaded dataset on the Power BI.

## Solution Provided
With its extensive insights into traffic safety trends, this interactive Power BI dashboard helps make educated decisions and encourages proactive steps to improve public safety. Knowing which regions have a high accident rate is helpful to the government. They learn about their areas for improvement through various graphs and visualisations, and they can then take the necessary actions by determining the areas that are prone to accidents. With the addition of area-wise detailed graphs and quarter options, we have dynamically enhanced the dashboard.
Used: <br>
1)Stacked bar charts <br>
2)Slicer (for selection of quarters and a particular area) <br>
3)Pie chart <br>
4)Summary of Total casualties and average speed limit <br>
5)Clustered charts
