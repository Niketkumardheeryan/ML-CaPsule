**Problem Statement:**
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

**PROJECT TITLE:** 
Flight Delay Prediction

**GOAL:** 
- Find out the selay of flights in according to given variables.

**DATASET link:**

**MODELS USED:**
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBossting
 

**WHAT I HAD DONE:**
I have done the following operations on the given dataset.
- Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Correlation
- Model Building
- Prediction.

**LIBRARIES NEEDED:**
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Sklearn

**Accuracy:**
- XGBClassifier
  0.9999948811798689
 
- Random Forrest
  0.99984977417536

**CONCLUSION:**
From all the model we get that XGboost is the best model predictor for Flight Delay Prediction. Hence the model built successfully and is ready to predict the churn score.
