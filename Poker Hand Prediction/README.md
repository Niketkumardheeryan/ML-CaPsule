
# Poker Hand Prediction

This project aims to predict poker hands using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing poker hands and their corresponding labels (hand rankings).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
- **S1, C1, S2, C2, S3, C3, S4, C4, S5, C5**: Suit and rank of each card in the hand.
- **CLASS**: Poker hand ranking (0 to 9), where 0 is the highest and 9 is the lowest.

## Files

- **poker-hand-training-true.csv**: CSV file containing the training data.
- **poker-hand-testing.csv**: CSV file containing the testing data.
- **Poker Hand Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone 
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd 003_Poker_Hand_Prediction
```

3. Open and run the `Poker Hand Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook Poker\ Hand\ Prediction.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
