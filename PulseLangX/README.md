The PulseLang is a Streamlit web application designed for translating between various dialects. The issue of language differences has long hindered effective communication. Over the years, difficulties in information exchange between countries have been prevalent. Traditionally, language interpreters need to be fluent in both the source and target languages. However, this method has proven neither productive nor favorable. Moreover, learning different languages can be challenging due to language barriers. Hiring a tutor incurs additional expenses and may not be the most efficient or effective method.
The web application supports translation between the most widely spoken languages globally, including English, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, French, and Chinese. This application can be particularly useful for tourists, enabling them to communicate effectively, integrate with local communities, and access accurate information.
