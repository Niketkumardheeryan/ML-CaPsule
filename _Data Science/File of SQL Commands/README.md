# File of SQL Commands
This directory consists of all the SQL commands required for the Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

## SQL [Structured Query Language]
SQL is just a query language; it is not a database. To perform SQL queries, you need to install any database, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostGre SQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc.

Points related to SQL :
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
- It is designed for managing data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
- It is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometime See-Qwell.
- SQL is a database language, it is used for database creation, deletion, fetching rows, and modifying rows, etc.
- SQL is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.

## Why SQL is required
SQL is required:
- To create new databases, tables and views
- To insert records in a database
- To update records in a database
- To delete records from a database
- To retrieve data from a database

To do all these operations we need to have the commands which are being used to do these operations.

All those commands are added in this directory!
Happy Coding!
