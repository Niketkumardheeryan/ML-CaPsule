# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning with Ultrasound Imaging

## üìù Abstract

Breast cancer detection is critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment. This project employs Deep Learning techniques to automate breast cancer detection using ultrasound imaging, aiming to enhance accuracy and facilitate timely interventions.

## üåê Context

Ultrasound imaging offers a non-invasive and widely accessible method for breast cancer screening. Leveraging Deep Learning on ultrasound images can improve diagnostic accuracy and streamline healthcare workflows.

## üîç Methodology

1. **Importing Libraries:**  
   - Essential libraries for data handling, visualization, and deep learning model construction are imported.

2. **Loading and Visualizing Ultrasound Images:**  
   - Ultrasound images from the dataset are loaded and visualized to gain insights into the data distribution.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Images are resized and prepared for model training, ensuring consistency and optimal input format.
   - Data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

4. **Model Creation:**
   - Three Deep Learning models are designed using TensorFlow and Keras:
     - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
     - VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
     - ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)

5. **Model Training:**  
   - Each model undergoes training on the training dataset with validation for performance assessment.

6. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Performance metrics including accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and classification report are computed for each model.

7. **Selecting the Best Model:**  
   - The model demonstrating the highest validation accuracy is identified as the best-performing model.
   - The best model is saved for future use and deployment.

8. **README.md Creation:**  
   - A README.md file is generated to provide project details, methodology, and directory structure information.

**Note:** Adjust file paths and names as per your local directory setup.
