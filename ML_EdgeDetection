Edge Detection: Extracting Image Features 
Edge detection is a fundamental technique in image processing that aims to identify points in 
an image where there is a sharp change in brightness. These points often correspond to object 
boundaries, corners, or other significant features. By extracting edges, we can simplify image 
data, preserve essential structural information, and facilitate further image analysis tasks. 
Common Edge Detection Techniques: 
• Gradient-Based Operators: 
  o Sobel Operator: Detects edges by computing the gradient approximation of the 
     image intensity function. 
  o Prewitt Operator: Similar to Sobel but uses simpler calculations. 
  o Canny Edge Detector: More complex but provides better results, involving 
    noise reduction, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, double 
    thresholding, and edge linking. 
• Laplacian-Based Operators: 
  o Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG): Detects edges by finding zero-crossings in the 
   second derivative of the image.
