# **Cloud Computing Platforms**
Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet. These services are divided into three main categories or types of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS).

## The most popularly used cloud service providers are:-
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
-  Google Cloud Platform
