# Bitcoin-Price-Predictor

## Short description of package/script

- This notebook demonstrates the prediction of the bitcoin price by the neural network model. 
- We are using long short term memory (LSTM)
### we will be going through a four step process to predict cryptocurrency prices:
1. Getting real-time crptocurrency data(bitcoin).
2. Prepare data for training and testing.
3. Predict the price of crptocurrency using LSTM neural network (deep learning).
4. Visualize the prediction results.
