# Portfolio Optimization Using Genetic Algorithms

## Overview
This project implements portfolio optimization using genetic algorithms to find the optimal asset allocation that maximizes returns and minimizes risk.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection:** Gather historical price data for a set of assets.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculate returns, volatility, and correlations.
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation:** Develop and apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the portfolio.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the optimized portfolio.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect historical price data for various assets from sources like Yahoo Finance, Quandl, or Bloomberg.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Calculate daily, monthly, or annual returns.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Compute metrics such as average return, standard deviation, and correlation matrix.

4. **Genetic Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Define the chromosome representation, fitness function, and genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation).
   - Optimize the portfolio by maximizing the Sharpe ratio or minimizing risk.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the optimized portfolio's performance against a benchmark.
   - Use metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, DEAP (for genetic algorithms)
