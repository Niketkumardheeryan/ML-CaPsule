# Insurance Dataset Regression

This repository contains a regression model for predicting medical insurance **charges** based on various attributes using the **Insurance Dataset** from Kaggle. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and region, and the goal is to predict the medical insurance charges (target variable).

## Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting medical insurance charges using a regression model. The dataset provided contains information such as the age, gender, BMI, and smoking habits of individuals, and the goal is to predict the charges associated with their medical insurance.

We use machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, to build an accurate regression model.

## Data Overview

The dataset used for this project is the **Insurance Dataset** available from Kaggle. It contains the following columns:

- **age**: Age of the individual.
- **sex**: Gender of the individual (male/female).
- **bmi**: Body mass index of the individual.
- **children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- **smoker**: Smoking status (yes/no).
- **region**: The region of the United States where the individual resides.
- **charges**: The medical insurance charges for the individual (target variable).

You can download the dataset from Kaggle: [Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e12/data)
