# Backpropagation Implementation from Scratch

This project implements an ANN using the backpropagation algorithm from scratch and tests it on a suitable dataset.
## Projects Overview
The notebook demonstrates the complete process of building and training an ANN, including:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Network Initialization
- Forward Propagation
- Backward Propagation
- Parameter Updates
- Accuracy Calculation
## Preprocessing
- Text Tokenization: Convert text into sequences of tokens.
- Padding Sequences: Pad the token sequences to ensure uniform input length.
- One-Hot Encoding: Convert labels to one-hot encoded format for training.
## Running the Notebook
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ML-CaPsule//Artifical neural network from scratch.git
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
