## Introduction
Feature selection is a critical step in machine learning that involves selecting a subset of relevant features for model building. This project demonstrates how to use Genetic Algorithms (GA) to perform feature selection, optimizing the performance of machine learning models.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to leverage Genetic Algorithms to select the best features for a given machine learning task. The project involves:

1. Implementing a Genetic Algorithm for feature selection.
2. Comparing the performance of models trained with all features versus the selected features.
3. Analyzing the results to determine the effectiveness of the Genetic Algorithm in feature selection.

## Methodology
The Genetic Algorithm (GA) follows these steps:

1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of feature subsets.
2. Selection: Evaluate the fitness of each subset using a predefined fitness function (e.g., model accuracy).
3. Crossover: Combine pairs of feature subsets to produce new offspring.
4. Mutation: Introduce random changes to feature subsets to maintain genetic diversity.
5. Replacement: Replace less fit subsets with new offspring.
6. Termination: Stop the algorithm after a set number of generations or if convergence criteria are met.

## Usage
1. Prepare dataset in a CSV file.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it if necessary.
3. Configure the Genetic Algorithm parameters.
4. Run the Genetic Algorithm to perform feature selection.
5. Evaluate the selected features using a machine learning model.
