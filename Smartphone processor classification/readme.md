**Smartphone processor classification**

**GOAL**

To classify the different processors of smartphones on the basis of collected data.

**DATASET**

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alanjo/smartphone-processors-ranking

**DESCRIPTION**

By this project I have done classification of the different processor of smartphones with the help of ANN algorithm.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

1.First I have imported different libraries like pandas, numpy, tensorflow,keras and etc.
2.Then I analyze the data and filter out the features which has the impact on the output.
3.Then I create two sets one of output and other of input.
4.Then I split data in train and test.
5.Then I apply the three different ANN model to it.
Then take the weighted average to get the best accuracy.

**MODELS USED**

I have implemented the ANN model to the project to get the better accuracy than the simple algorithms

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1.pandas 
2.numpy 
3.tensorflow
4.keras
5.matplotlib.pyplot 
6.sklearn.
7.pydot
8.ann_visualizer
9.graphviz

**ACCURACIES**

ANN model provies the accuracy of approx 57 percent.
accuracy: 0.5733


**CONCLUSION**

By this model I have classified different processor on the basis of different processor scores.
This model gave me 57 percent accuracy.
