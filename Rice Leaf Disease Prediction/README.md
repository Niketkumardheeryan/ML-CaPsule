# Rice Leaf Disease Prediction Model
## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the type of disease affecting rice leaves based on images of the leaves.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 120 images of rice leaves, grouped into three classes based on the type of disease:
- **Leaf Smut**: 40 images
- **Brown Spot**: 40 images
- **Bacterial Leaf Blight**: 40 images

The images are in JPG format and can be accessed at the following link:

## Model Description
The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify the images of rice leaves into one of the three disease classes. The model is trained using a combination of convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from the images, followed by fully connected layers to make the final predictions.

## Model Performance
The model achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in classifying rice leaf diseases.
