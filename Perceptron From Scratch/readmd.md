Here is a short README file for your Perceptron implementation:
# Perceptron Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification. The Perceptron is a type of linear classifier that updates its weights and bias based on the errors made on the training data.

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

The `perceptron` class is implemented with methods to fit the model to the training data and make predictions on new data. The dataset used in the example is generated using `make_blobs` from `scikit-learn`.

## Results

The accuracy of the model is printed after training and predicting on the test set. Additionally, a plot is generated to visualize the decision boundary learned by the perceptron.

## How to Use This Repository

- Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Niketkumardheeryan/ML-CaPsule/Perceptron From Scratch
```
- For Python implementations and visualizations:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed 

```bash
  pip install jupyter
```
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Open perceptron.ipynb.
